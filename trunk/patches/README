         Patches
==============================

this directory contains patches to add AVR back-end to the build-scripts of 
the LLVM trunk.

- configure.ac.diff
 this patch should be quite stable and might work even if the base files changes

- configure.diff
 the configure script is autogen'ed using the configure.ac file. Minor changes is
 the .ac file will result in major changes in the configure script. If the file 
 changes in the LLVM repo it must be regenerated using the merged configure.ac
 but setting up the autoregen environment is not so easy...
